# Task

Study the codebase. Find the most important thing to implement.
Implement it completely. Run tests. Commit with a descriptive message.

# Plan

Track progress here. The agent will check items off as it works.

- [ ] (next task to implement)

# Rules

ONE task per session. Pick the next unchecked [ ] item from the Plan,
implement it, mark it [x], commit, and exit.

Search the codebase before implementing to avoid duplicating existing code.

No placeholders or TODOs. Implement completely or don't implement at all.

Run tests before committing. If tests fail, fix them first.

Keep commits atomic - one logical change per commit.

# Guardrails

Add new guardrails here when you observe failure patterns.
Use high numbers for critical rules (e.g., 99999).
